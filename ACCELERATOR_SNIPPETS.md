# PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

## One-liner (10 words)
> Vivy: Create AI trading strategies with plain English, not code.

## One sentence (25 words)
> Vivy is a no-code AI trading platform that lets anyone create automated trading strategies using natural language, democratizing algorithmic trading for the masses.

## Short description (50 words)
> Vivy is "The Kaggle for Financial AI Agents." Users create AI trading agents by writing strategies in plain English instead of Python. Our platform uses LLMs to analyze market news, generate trade recommendations with full reasoning, and crowdsources "semantic alpha" - trading strategies based on human insight, not just statistics.

## Medium description (100 words)
> Vivy democratizes algorithmic trading by replacing code with natural language. Instead of writing Python, users describe their trading strategy in plain English: "Buy tech stocks after positive earnings when PE is below average." Our AI reads real market news, applies the strategy, and generates trade recommendations with full explainable reasoning.
>
> Users compete on a public leaderboard, creating a crowdsourced dataset of "semantic alpha" - trading strategies based on human reasoning. We monetize through subscriptions (B2C), sponsored trading challenges from hedge funds (B2B), and licensing top-performing strategies to institutions.
>
> The working prototype is live, built by a solo founder with 4 years in data science and AI.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT

## Short version
> 99% of people with market insights can't act on them because algorithmic trading requires programming skills (Python, R, C++).

## Medium version
> Algorithmic trading is a $14B+ market growing 12% annually, but it's locked behind programming skills. You need Python, R, or C++ to participate. That means millions of people with genuine market insights - patterns they see in earnings calls, news events, market behavior - have no way to act on them. Great ideas, zero execution.

## With supporting data
> The algorithmic trading market is $14.1B (2024) growing at 12.2% CAGR. But it only serves the ~1% of traders who can code. Post-2020, retail trading exploded - 150M+ retail traders globally. They have opinions and want automation, but existing tools (Quantopian, Alpaca) still require programming. AI is now smart enough to understand natural language trading strategies, but no one has built the interface. Until now.

# SOLUTION

## Short version
> Vivy lets you create AI trading agents using plain English. Write your strategy, and our AI executes it with full explainable reasoning.

## With example
> Instead of writing 200 lines of Python, users write: "Buy tech stocks when their PE ratio drops below industry average after positive earnings surprises. Sell if price drops 5% or rises 15%." That's it. Our AI (Claude) reads real market news, applies the strategy, and generates trade recommendations with full reasoning - not a black box.

# WHY NOW?

## Bullet points
> - AI is finally good enough: LLMs now reason at PhD-level and can explain decisions
> - Agentic AI is the defining trend of 2025: AI that takes action, not just answers questions
> - Retail trading explosion: Post-2020, millions of new traders want automation
> - Regulatory tailwinds: AI explainability is becoming required; our reasoning-first approach is compliant by design

## Narrative version
> This wasn't possible 2 years ago. AI couldn't reliably reason about financial decisions. Now, models like Claude can analyze earnings calls, news sentiment, and market data at PhD-level and explain their reasoning. Meanwhile, "agentic AI" - AI that takes action - is the hottest trend in tech. Trading is the perfect use case: high-stakes decisions that benefit from reasoning and explainability. The timing is perfect.

# BUSINESS MODEL

## Short version
> B2C subscriptions ($19-49/mo) + B2B sponsored challenges ($5K-50K) + institutional strategy licensing (revenue share).

## Detailed version
> **B2C - Individual Traders:**
> - Free: 10 analyses/day, manual execution
> - Pro ($19/mo): 100 analyses, auto-execute, alerts
> - Power ($49/mo): Unlimited, API access, priority
>
> **B2B - Institutional:**
> - Sponsored Challenges: Hedge funds pay $5K-50K to sponsor trading competitions, winners get prizes, sponsors get access to winning strategies
> - Strategy Licensing: Top strategies licensed to institutions on revenue share (70% creator / 30% platform)
> - Enterprise: White-label platform for trading firms ($10K+/mo)

## Unit economics
> Cost per AI analysis: ~$0.003 (Claude API). Pro subscription is $19/month. If a Pro user runs 50 analyses/month, cost is $0.15 vs. $19 revenue = 99%+ gross margin.

---

# TRACTION / STATUS

## Pre-launch version (current)
> Working prototype complete: AI-powered trading analysis, real market data integration (Finnhub), portfolio management with P&L tracking, public leaderboard, risk controls (stop-loss, position limits), cost transparency. Ready for beta user onboarding.

## If you have users (update later)
> [X] users signed up, [Y] AI analyses run, [Z] trades executed. Growing [W]% week-over-week.

# COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE / MOAT

## Short version
> First no-code AI trading platform with explainable reasoning. Network effects from leaderboard + unique "semantic alpha" dataset that improves with scale.

## Detailed version
> 1. **No-code AI trading:** Competitors (Quantopian, Alpaca) require programming. We're first to remove this barrier.
> 2. **Explainability:** Every trade has full reasoning, unlike black-box trading bots. Regulatory advantage.
> 3. **Semantic alpha dataset:** We crowdsource trading strategies based on human reasoning - unique dataset no one else has.
> 4. **Network effects:** More users = better leaderboard = more strategies = more institutional interest = more users.

## Competitors
> - Quantopian (shut down): Required Python, we're no-code
> - eToro (copy trading): Copy trades, not reasoning; no AI
> - Alpaca: API for trading bots, still requires code
> - Trade Ideas: AI alerts only, no full strategy execution
> - ChatGPT: Can discuss trading but no execution, no portfolio

# FOUNDER / TEAM

## Bio (short)
> Vaibhav Talekar - 4 years in data science and software engineering at startups, currently completing MSc in Artificial Intelligence at University of Surrey. Full-stack builder: AI + Backend + Frontend.

## Bio (medium)
> Vaibhav Talekar is a full-stack technical founder with 4 years of industry experience. He worked as a Data Scientist and Subject Matter Expert at an early-stage startup that scaled significantly, then as a Software Engineer. He's currently completing his MSc in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Surrey. He built the entire Vivy prototype solo, demonstrating strong execution ability across AI, backend, and frontend.

## Why you?
> I combine data science expertise (3 years), software engineering skills (1 year), and cutting-edge AI knowledge (MSc). I built this working prototype while studying full-time. I'm also a personal investor, so I understand the user pain point firsthand. I ship fast and I'm looking for mentorship on go-to-market and institutional partnerships.

# WHY THIS MATTERS TO YOU (Personal Story)

## Version 1: Investor angle
> I invest for myself and my family. I see patterns in earnings calls and market news. But acting on those insights requires writing trading bots in Python. Most people give up here. I believe AI is now smart enough to bridge this gap. If someone has a good idea about markets, code shouldn't be the barrier.

## Version 2: AI democratization angle
> AI is moving towards "vibe coding" - you describe what you want, AI builds it. Accounting, legal, coding - all getting AI interfaces. Why not investing? I believe models are now PhD-level smart, capable of making decisions better than most traders. Vivy democratizes that capability for everyone.

# COMMON YC QUESTIONS

## "What are you working on?"
> Vivy - a no-code AI trading platform. Users create trading strategies in plain English, our AI executes them with full explainable reasoning.

## "What is new about what you're doing?"
> Algorithmic trading has always required programming. We're the first to make it accessible via natural language. Plus, we provide full reasoning for every trade - something no black-box trading bot does.

## "What's your business model?"
> Subscriptions for individuals ($19-49/mo), sponsored trading challenges from hedge funds ($5K-50K each), and licensing top strategies to institutions.

## "Who are your competitors?"
> Quantopian (shut down, required code), Alpaca (API, requires code), eToro (copy trading, no AI reasoning). No one is doing no-code AI trading with explainability.

## "How will you make money?"
> B2C subscriptions get us users and baseline revenue. B2B sponsored challenges and strategy licensing is where the real revenue is - hedge funds pay premium for alpha.

## "How much have you raised?"
> Bootstrapped/self-funded so far. Looking for accelerator support to go full-time.

## "What progress have you made?"
> Built complete working prototype: AI trading analysis with Claude, real market data via Finnhub, portfolio tracking, leaderboard, risk management. Ready for beta users.

## "What's the biggest risk?"
> Regulatory complexity in fintech. Mitigated by: paper trading initially, explainability built-in (helps with compliance), clear disclaimers (not financial advice).

## "Why will you succeed?"
> I can build fast (shipped working prototype while studying), I understand both AI and the user problem (I'm a personal investor), and the timing is perfect (agentic AI + retail trading boom).
