# YC Application Video Script
## Vivy - "The Kaggle for Financial AI Agents"

**Target Length:** 1-2 minutes (YC prefers concise)
**Format:** Founder talking to camera + screen recordings

---

## SCRIPT OPTION A: The Direct Approach (Recommended)
*~90 seconds*

---

### SECTION 1: HOOK + INTRO (0:00 - 0:15)
**[Face to camera, casual but confident]**

> "Hi, I'm Vaibhav. I'm building Vivy - the Kaggle for financial AI agents.
>
> We let anyone create AI trading strategies using plain English instead of code."

---

### SECTION 2: THE PROBLEM (0:15 - 0:30)
**[Face to camera]**

> "Here's the problem: Algorithmic trading is a $14 billion market, but it's locked behind programming skills.
>
> You need Python, R, or C++ to participate. That means 99% of people with market insights can't act on them.
>
> Great ideas. No way to execute."

---

### SECTION 3: THE SOLUTION + DEMO (0:30 - 1:00)
**[Switch to screen recording of the product]**

> "Vivy changes that. Instead of writing code, you write English."

**[Show agent creation screen with strategy prompt]**

> "This is a trading strategy. Plain text. No coding."

**[Show clicking "Analyze" and results appearing]**

> "Our AI reads real market news, analyzes it against your strategy, and gives you a trade recommendation..."

**[Highlight the reasoning section]**

> "...with full reasoning. Not a black box. Every decision is explainable."

**[Show portfolio or leaderboard briefly]**

> "Users compete on a public leaderboard. We crowdsource what we call 'semantic alpha' - trading strategies based on reasoning, not just statistics."

---

### SECTION 4: BUSINESS MODEL (1:00 - 1:15)
**[Back to face to camera]**

> "We make money three ways:
>
> Subscriptions for individual traders.
> Sponsored challenges - hedge funds pay to find the best strategies.
> And licensing top strategies to institutions."

---

### SECTION 5: WHY ME + ASK (1:15 - 1:30)
**[Face to camera, lean in slightly]**

> "I have 4 years in data science and software engineering, now doing my Master's in AI.
>
> I built this working prototype to prove the concept works.
>
> I'm looking for YC to help me scale - the product is ready, I need help with go-to-market and institutional partnerships.
>
> Thanks for watching."

## SCRIPT OPTION B: The Story Approach
*~100 seconds - more personal, slightly longer*

---

### SECTION 1: PERSONAL HOOK (0:00 - 0:20)
**[Face to camera, conversational]**

> "I invest for myself and my family. I have ideas about the market. But I always hit the same wall.
>
> I see a pattern in earnings calls. I want to automate a trade. And then I realize... I'd need to write Python. Build a trading bot. Deal with APIs.
>
> Most people just give up here. I decided to fix it."

---

### SECTION 2: WHAT WE BUILT (0:20 - 0:35)
**[Face to camera, then switch to screen]**

> "I'm Vaibhav, and I built Vivy. It's the Kaggle for financial AI agents.
>
> You create trading strategies in plain English..."

**[Show agent creation]**

> "...and our AI does the rest."

---

### SECTION 3: THE DEMO (0:35 - 1:00)
**[Screen recording with voiceover]**

> "Here's how it works."

**[Click Analyze, show results loading]**

> "The AI reads real market news, applies your strategy, and gives you a recommendation."

**[Show reasoning text]**

> "Most importantly - full reasoning. Not a black box. You see exactly why it's recommending this trade."

**[Show leaderboard]**

> "Users compete publicly. We're building a dataset of 'semantic alpha' - trading strategies based on human reasoning. That's something no one else has."

---

### SECTION 4: THE OPPORTUNITY (1:00 - 1:20)
**[Back to face]**

> "Algorithmic trading is $14 billion. But it only serves people who code.
>
> We unlock 100x more users by removing that barrier.
>
> Business model: subscriptions, sponsored challenges from hedge funds, and licensing top strategies to institutions."

---

### SECTION 5: THE ASK (1:20 - 1:40)
**[Face to camera, direct]**

> "I'm a solo founder - 4 years in data science and engineering, now finishing my AI Master's.
>
> The product works. I need help scaling it.
>
> I want YC's network to connect with institutional investors and get go-to-market mentorship.
>
> I believe AI should democratize finance. Thanks for considering Vivy."

# RECORDING TIPS

## Setup
- **Camera:** Webcam or phone at eye level
- **Lighting:** Face a window (natural light) or use a ring light
- **Background:** Clean, minimal - bookshelf or plain wall
- **Audio:** Quiet room, use headphone mic if needed
- **Dress:** Casual but neat (t-shirt or button-up)

## Delivery
- **Pace:** Slightly faster than conversational (YC reviewers watch many videos)
- **Eye contact:** Look at the camera lens, not the screen
- **Energy:** Enthusiastic but not over-the-top
- **Confidence:** You built something real - show it

## Screen Recording
- **Resolution:** 1920x1080
- **Browser:** Chrome/Firefox, hide bookmarks bar
- **Tabs:** Only have the app open
- **Mouse:** Move deliberately, don't rush clicks
- **Transitions:** Cut between face and screen (don't use fancy transitions)

## Editing
- **Tool:** iMovie, CapCut, or DaVinci Resolve (all free)
- **Cuts:** Simple cuts, no flashy effects
- **Music:** None (YC prefers no background music)
- **Length:** AIM FOR 60-90 SECONDS. Shorter is better.
- **Subtitles:** Optional but helpful

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
❌ Reading from a script (sounds robotic)
❌ Too much jargon
❌ Spending too long on the problem
❌ Not showing the product
❌ Being too formal or stiff
❌ Videos over 2 minutes
